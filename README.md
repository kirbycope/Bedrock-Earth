# Bedrock-Earth
Minecraft Earth was an augmented reality sandbox game developed by Mojang Studios and published by Xbox Game Studios. It was sunet and made my 7 year old very sad. We randomly watched a video about changing mobs on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OI1mfEEBZEM) and got inspired to make our own. I have made two datapacks ([CopeCraft](https://github.com/kirbycope/CopeCraft) and [SkyBlock](https://github.com/kirbycope/SkyBlock)) for Minecraft Java so this was a nice challange that used previously learned code.

I modified the models and behaviors of the mobs my son suggested (chicken and iron_golem). My wife did the textures. My son and I made the map. I also wrote a small datapack that gives you the spawn eggs if it is your first time joining the map.
